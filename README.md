# Meteors ☄️
Cuberite plugin that add new structure: falling meteors with good loot!

Commands:
'/meteors prob [number]' - change the probability of a meteor per chunk. _Note: this method changes the value for a while, and after full reload of plugins, it will return to the default value written in code._

Thats all! Happy travelling!
